# Networked-Physics
Physics sandbox on node.js.  Simulation runs on both server and client for smooth experience, and user interaction with the canvas is sent to the server to let it be the master of the simulation (prevents cheating in online games).

### How to Use
Start app.js using node.
Access app through browser (either localhost or domain/server ip)

## Dependencies
P2.js - Physics
Socket.io - Websockets for networking
Express - Hosts app for client
